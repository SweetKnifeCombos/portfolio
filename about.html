		<p>
			I am anticipating graduation during May 2017 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a
			Bachelors of Science in psychology with a concentration in behavioral neuroscience. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I have begun pivoting my education toward a future career in UX research and design. 
			While I greatly enjoy research, I want to be a more active member in its application. 
			I think that human-centered design could benefit from findings made in cognitive, social, and personality
			psychology, and I want to bring that perspective to an innovative team. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In the short to medium term, I am looking for an internship then full-time employment in UX research
			and/or design. In the future, I aim to pursue a Masters degree in human-computer interaction.
